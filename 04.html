							<h1>Crowded events</h1>
							<h3>Participation and design of inmersive experiences in crowded events</h3>
							<h3>2022-2024</h3>
									<p><u><i>LFDM 2022</i></u>: 
										The event La Feria de la Música 2022 took place at La Rural, a venue in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was a large music fair featuring stands from local producers, 
										top-level musicians, and a main stage with live performances. Additionally, it hosted conferences and workshops on music production, sound engineering, and the music business.

										The event was considered a great success, attracting over 10,000 visitors across three days. For me, as an intern in the engineering department, it was an invaluable opportunity 
										to learn about large-scale event organization, the importance of pre-production, and the challenges of working in a crowded venue.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/pic04_2.jpg" alt="" /></span><u><i>Workshow 2023</i></u>: 
										The Workshow 2023 event was held at EXOSOUND’s offices, offering multiple experiences centered on two main themes: immersive audio and new technologies in audiovisual environments. 
										The event was live-streamed and also attended in person. It featured several dedicated spaces: There was a room with the L-acoustics L-ISA Auditoria system,
										another space with a Dolby Atmos studio, a room focused on fixed installation equipment, a section with Dolby Atmos for headphones and home entertainment,
										and a dome with immersive audio experiences for gaming. All of this was set up in just two days, with intense work and plenty of fun.
										<br><br/>
										My role involved designing the fixed installation room, developing a system capable of managing multiple microphones using AVB and Dante protocols simultaneously. 
										Guests were able to test different microphones and speakers, all controlled from a single central panel.
										Additionally, I conducted two webinars that were broadcast during the event, one on Biamp's AEC processing and tips for good audio installation
										and the other on Audio-Technica's beamforming ceiling microphone and its applications in fixed installations.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/pic04_3.jpg" alt="" /></span><u><i>Workshow 2024</i></u>:
										The Workshow 2024 event took place at Concept C | Art Media, located in Chacarita, Buenos Aires. This edition focused on emerging technologies and trends in 
										audiovisual environments, with a particular emphasis on immersive audio. We were joined by notable partners such as Billboard, Avixa, Rolling Stone, and Vorterix, 
										along with top audio brands including IK Multimedia, Audio-Technica, Solid State Logic, L-Acoustics, Biamp, and Yamaha, among others.
										<br><br/>
										I was responsible for technical supervision of the entire first floor, which was dedicated to the audiovisual industry. This sector introduced the “Solution Hunters” 
										experience, an initiative inviting the industry to present new solutions, tools, and inclusive technologies that enable people of all abilities to fully participate in technological spaces.
										<br><br/><br>
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/pic04_1.jpg" alt="" /></span><u><i>Workshow 2025 - Live sessions</i></u>: 
										Once again hosted at C Art Media, Workshow 2025 marked a milestone in the industry, it was the first live music event produced with L-ISA Hyperreal that was later mixed and broadcast in 
										Dolby Atmos format. The event also featured presentations by leading professionals in music production and live sound.
										<br><br/>
										In this edition, I served as the General Technical Manager, overseeing and assisting all areas as needed. The event was a resounding success, achieving outstanding technical performance 
										and a high level of in-person attendance — a rare accomplishment for events of this scale.
