							<h3>Predictive models for urgency perception in railway crossing alarm signals: Development and applications for Argentina.</h3>
							<h3>1Q - 2024</h3>
									<!--<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01_1.png" alt="" /></span><u><i>Abstract</i></u>: This document describes the design of a small ambechoic control room for a recording studio,
										for 8 people according to the DISPO regulations of CABA, Argentina. Five different monitoring
										systems were installed, two for stereo productions, one for binaural audio productions, and
										one for 3D audio productions. Acoustic treatment and soundproofing calculations are also
										included. The reverberation time obtained in the different frequency bands were within the
										tolerances established by the AES.</p><br><br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01_2.png" alt="" /></span>The ambechoic spaces refer to the “ambient anechoic rooms”, conceptually these ambients
										provide a uniform acoustical environment in rooms which utilize surround systems. This
										concept was developed by Petrović and Dadović [3] to apply in small rooms (less than 80 m3).
										The basic initial design conditions defined by them are homogenous diffusion on all surfaces
										above approximately 1 kHz, except the floor; and maximum possible absorption in frequencies
										below 250 Hz, homogenous on all surfaces except the floor.</p><br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01_3.jpg" alt="" /></span> Some tools used to provide the design of the control room are the BEM (Boundary element method) simulations 
										to study the modes below the Schreder frequency, the simulation of the absorption and diffusion to provide an optimal RT all across the frequency bands, and the trasmission loss calculation
										in order to satisfy the law N°1540. Furthermore, the analysis of multichannel monitoring and the speakers often in the market, and the calculation of the ventilation required to
										keep low levels of C02 in the control room.</p><br><br>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01_1.png" alt="" /></span><u><i>Abstract</i></u>: This study develops predictive models for the perceived
										 urgency of railway crossing alarm signals, focusing on both frequency and temporal variables. Two subjective tests using incomplete pairwise comparison 
										 matrices were conducted to evaluate the influence of these variables. For each test, nine synthetic signals are generated based 
										 on the alarm sound currently used in Buenos Aires. The results demonstrate that all four variables significantly affect perceived urgency, with temporal variables 
										 contributing more to perceived urgency than frequency variables. Multiple regression analyses revealed that higher harmonic amplitude and pitch increase 
										 perceived urgency, with harmonic attenuation having a greater impact. Similarly, faster speeds and shorter attack times heightened perceived urgency, with 
										 nearly equal contributions from both variables. The study proposes specific alarm configurations to maximize perceived urgency in accordance with Argentinean 
										 regulations. These findings suggest the potential for improved alarm design to enhance safety at railway crossings. 
									</p><br><br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01_2.png" alt="" /></span> Alarm signals serve as crucial indicators, alert individuals to situations requiring immediate attention 
										They are ubiquitous across various environments, including as fire alarms, vehicles, schools, and public transit systems. This study focuses 
										on railway crossing alarm signals, recognizing their vital role in ensuring safety at railway crossings.
										The statistical yearbook for 2022, released by the JST (Junta de Seguridad en el Transporte), revealed concerning data regarding railway crossings in Buenos Aires, 
										underscoring the seriousness of incidents involving pedestrians, vehicles, and warning signals. A total of 357 pedestrian and 209 
										vehicle collisions were documented, shedding light on the persistent risk of accidents at railway crossings.
										</p><br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01_3.png" alt="" /></span> A notable difference in perceived urgency was observed between recommended alarms with the minimum 
										and maximum scale values, particularly concerning the temporal variables.  
										These results encouraged us to continue working toward the publication of a summarized version of the thesis.
										In May 2025, our article titled “Development of Predictive Models for Urgency Perception in Alarm Signals at Railway Crossings in Argentina” was accepted for publication in 
										the journal Applied Acoustics. This achievement represents a significant milestone in the dissemination of our findings and contributions to the field of applied acoustics.
										That same year, the UNTREF authorities selected our work to represent the Sound Engineering program in the engineering thesis competition organized by INVAP. Both recognitions 
										stand as a testament to the effort and dedication invested in this research.
