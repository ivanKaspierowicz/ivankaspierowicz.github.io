									<!--<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt=""/></span><u><i>Abstract</i></u>: This measurement report 
										the behavior of three microphones through measurement by transfer function method taking as reference the Earthworks M-50 with flat response, the results obtained
										were that in first place the RE-320 microphone is limited between (60 Hz - 12 kHz), with +6 dB boost at high frequencies. 
										Secondly, the HSR3.2 whose frequency response is limited between (32 Hz; 16 kHz), with two resonances in low frequencies and a boost in high frequencies.
										Finally, the frequency response of the Samsom Q6 is reduced between (60 Hz; 16 kHz), with a lot of attenuation in low frequencies, a resonance
										in 200 Hz, and a boost in high frequencies. The measured data are validated and compared with the specifications provided by the manufacturers,
										these being similar, except in the case of the EV-RE320 which will be discussed throughout the report.</p><br><br><br>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic07_3.jpg" alt=""></span> Three types of measurements are used: Frequency response (front-back comparison)
										for every microphone; directivity for the EV-RE320 and the HSA-2 in bidirectional pattern; and proximity effect for the EV-RE320 and the HSA-2 in cardioid pattern.
										In all the measurements a transfer function method is used with a pseudo-aleatory pink noise audio input in order to realize the coherence analysis.

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic07_1.jpg" alt="" height="300"/></span> Music has always been part of my life. Ever since I was a kid and played guitar, 
									sound has fascinated me. I have been a guitar player for many years, with denoted musical influences like blues, rock, and jazz fusion. 
									But I was also on the other side as a spectator. I really enjoy listening to music and assisting live sound performances. <br><br>
									I also enjoy nature through sports. I practice sports like football, running, cycling, and trekking. This last one is one of my favourites 
									because it allows you to do exercise and enjoy the landscapes at the same time.
									One of my life goals is to visit all the national parks in Argentina. </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic07_2.jpg" alt="" height="300"></span> 
									Another hobby, inherited from my brother, is photography. He's a graphic designer, and he taught me the basics of photography from a different perspective. 
									I would like to keep practicing and learning about it, getting new lenses and equipment that allow me to experiment and improve my skills.
									<br><br>
									Finally, one of my favorite activities is to watch motorsports, especially Formula 1. I have been following this category since I was a kid, 
									and it's a passion that I share with my family. So, it's not only a hobby; it's a nice moment to share. </p>
