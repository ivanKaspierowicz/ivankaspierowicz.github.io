									<!--<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05_2.png" alt=""/></span><u><i>Abstract</i></u>: This document describes the design realized for the Circuitos Electrónicos I subject.
									The design proposed is the creation of a guitar cabinet emulator with two selections, Marshall style and Mesa-Boogie with an extra two bands EQ active filter.
									Through the series connection of different filters, it was possible to imitate the frequency response of these cabinets in a way
									quite satisfactory. Once obtained the two RIR's from a professional company through a subjective preference selection a 
									frequency analysis is done and three points of reference are selected (a,b, and c for both RIR's).</p><br>
									<p><span class="image right2"><img src="images/pic05_3.jpg" alt=""/></span> Before the experimental assembly of the circuit, we proceeded 
									to make drafts and simulate them digitally until the objectives set out above were reached. The simulations involve four different filter topologies: Sallen key High-Pass filter with
									a cut frequency (fc) of 90 Hz and 12 dB/oct decay; Sallen key Low-Pass filter with an fc of 6 kHz and 12 dB/oct; two resonant filters with central frequencies in 111 Hz and 625 Hz with 
									selectivity factor (Q) of 2 and 5 accordingly; finally a Notch filter with a center frequency of 330 Hz. Then, the experimental circuit is executed in a breadboard to facilitate the possible
									changes along with the measurements. </p><br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05_1.jpg" alt="" /></span> The final results are measured with a band-limited pink noise and then a subjective test is made. Even if the results 
									don't show a perfect correlation between the original impulse responses the subjective test reveals a great sound and reaches the principal aim of this work which is to get a good tone when an electric guitar
									is used through a speaker monitor.   </p><br><br><br><br>-->
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05_1.png" alt="" /></span> This section describes all the trainings and certifications that I have
									taken in the last few years. I personally believe that the learning process is a never-ending journey, and that is why I am always 
									looking to stay updated with the latest technologies and methodologies. </p>
									<p>A large portion of the courses are from the brand Biamp. This company is a leader in the audio-video industry, and they have a wide range of products 
									that are used in different applications. Its portfolio is really big, so it's crucial to be well informed. Because of this, I have taken courses like the 
									TesiraFORTÉ Certification, optimized control design for all the Impera family of products, the Cambridge Qt X Certification for design and deployment of 
									sound masking systems, and the TesiraSERVER Certification for the design and deployment of larger Tesira systems. </p>
									</p>
									<p>Dante is the industry standard digital audio protocol, and that's the reason why I have taken courses like Dante Level 1-2-3 and multiple webinars like 
									Dante Cloud-Based Audio Production and Dante Director. These courses helped me in big scenarios, like fixed installations with Dante/AES67, Dolby Atmos systems, 
									broadcast scenarios using the System T console from Solid State Logic, and redundant Dante networks, among others.   </p>
									<p> Last but not least, I also took two L-Acoustics courses to improve my abilities to design and deploy audio systems from this brand. System & Workflow and Soundvision 
									are the last two courses that I have taken and were extremely useful for designing sound systems and understanding the new technologies and applications for live sound. </p>
