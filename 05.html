									<!--<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05_2.png" alt=""/></span><u><i>Abstract</i></u>: This document describes the design realized for the Circuitos Electr칩nicos I subject.
									The design proposed is the creation of a guitar cabinet emulator with two selections, Marshall style and Mesa-Boogie with an extra two bands EQ active filter.
									Through the series connection of different filters, it was possible to imitate the frequency response of these cabinets in a way
									quite satisfactory. Once obtained the two RIR's from a professional company through a subjective preference selection a 
									frequency analysis is done and three points of reference are selected (a,b, and c for both RIR's).</p><br>
									<p><span class="image right2"><img src="images/pic05_3.jpg" alt=""/></span> Before the experimental assembly of the circuit, we proceeded 
									to make drafts and simulate them digitally until the objectives set out above were reached. The simulations involve four different filter topologies: Sallen key High-Pass filter with
									a cut frequency (fc) of 90 Hz and 12 dB/oct decay; Sallen key Low-Pass filter with an fc of 6 kHz and 12 dB/oct; two resonant filters with central frequencies in 111 Hz and 625 Hz with 
									selectivity factor (Q) of 2 and 5 accordingly; finally a Notch filter with a center frequency of 330 Hz. Then, the experimental circuit is executed in a breadboard to facilitate the possible
									changes along with the measurements. </p><br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05_1.jpg" alt="" /></span> The final results are measured with a band-limited pink noise and then a subjective test is made. Even if the results 
									don't show a perfect correlation between the original impulse responses the subjective test reveals a great sound and reaches the principal aim of this work which is to get a good tone when an electric guitar
									is used through a speaker monitor.   </p><br><br><br><br>-->
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05_1.png" alt="" /></span> This section outlines the trainings and certifications I have completed over the past few years. I strongly believe that learning is 
									a never-ending journey, which is why I am always seeking to stay up to date with the latest technologies and methodologies. </p>
									<p>A large portion of these courses come from Biamp, a global leader in the audio-video industry with a broad portfolio of products used in diverse applications. Given the wide range of their solutions, staying 
									well-informed is essential. For this reason, I have completed several Biamp certifications, including:
									TesiraFORTE패 Certification, optimized control design for all the Impera family of products, the Cambridge Qt X Certification for design and deployment of 
									sound masking systems, and the TesiraSERVER Certification for the design and deployment of larger Tesira systems. </p>
									</p>
									<p>Since Dante is the industry-standard digital audio protocol, I have also taken multiple courses and webinars, including Dante Levels 1, 2, and 3, as 
									well as sessions on Dante Cloud-Based Audio Production and Dante Director. These courses have proven highly valuable in complex projects such as fixed installations with Dante/AES67, 
									Dolby Atmos systems, broadcast environments using the SSL System T console, and redundant Dante networks, among others.   </p>
									<p> Finally, I have also completed three L-Acoustics courses to strengthen my skills in system design and deployment: System & Workflow, Soundvision, and Variable Curvature Line Source. 
									These trainings have been extremely useful for designing sound systems and for understanding emerging technologies and live-sound applications. </p>
