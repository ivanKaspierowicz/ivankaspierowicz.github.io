									The design proposed is the creation of a guitar cabinet emulator with two selections, Marshall style and Mesa-Boogie with an extra two bands EQ active filter.
									Through the series connection of different filters, it was possible to imitate the frequency response of these cabinets in a way
									quite satisfactory. Once obtained the two RIR's from a professional company through a subjective preference selection a

									to make drafts and simulate them digitally until the objectives set out above were reached. The simulations involve four different filter topologies: Sallen key High-Pass filter with
									a cut frequency (fc) of 90 Hz and 12 dB/oct decay; Sallen key Low-Pass filter with an fc of 6 kHz and 12 dB/oct; two resonant filters with central frequencies in 111 Hz and 625 Hz with 
									selectivity factor (Q) of 2 and 5 accordingly; finally a Notch filter with a center frequency of 330 Hz. Then, the experimental circuit is executed in a breadboard to facilitate the possible
									changes along with the measurements. </p><br>

									is used through a speaker monitor.   </p><br><br><br><br>-->

									<p>This section shows the professional recordings
									made over the Master. Some music genres involved are Jazz, Folklore, Rock, and classical music and take place in iconical recording studios such as Panda (Charly Garcia,
									Los abuelos de la nada, Mercedes Sosa, Etc).   </p>
									<p>Make a professional recording starts when the musicians arrive at the studio.
									Is necessary to understand what music they do and set up an audio reference (depending on the genre), then the selection of the best microphones to make
								 	a reality that sound in the engineer's mind. During the recording, the musicians must have the best audio return possible to improve their comfort. The last step is 
									to make the mix of the song setting the places of the instruments and a characteristical sound.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic08_4.jpg" alt="" /></span></p><br><br>
									<p>The samples show some mixes made for elite musicians like Mario Parmisano (pianist: Al di Meola, Chick corea, Herbie Hancock,...)
									in a concert made in the Auditorium in the Tres de Febrero University. In other genres like folklore the artist Diego arolfo with an extensive music trajectory in Argentina and the World.</p><br><br>-->

									I have participated in during my time at university. To provide a clearer understanding of the range of assignments and the workload involved, you can visit

									<p><u><i>Auditorium design (2019)</i></u>: A new concert hall was designed on the site of the existing Teatro Auditorium in Buenos Aires. The main external noise sources 
									identified were pedestrian movement and heavy traffic. The building program included a lobby, ticket office, cafeteria/bar, dressing and practice rooms for performers, restrooms, staff offices, machine rooms, 
									and the main hall. Within the hall, 960 seats were arranged across two levels in accordance with Buenos Aires City building codes. The selected materials resulted in a reverberation time (RT) of 1.97 s at mid 
									frequencies. A triangular reflector panel was designed above the front audience area to improve the initial time delay gap, maintaining it between 15 ms and 35 ms.
									Acoustic simulations indicated that the final design provided an SPL variation of less than 4 dB, an EDT of 1.63 s at 1 kHz, and an IAGG of 0.25 s at 1 kHz, ensuring balanced sound coverage and high acoustic quality for the audience.

									APC is a software tool developed for room impulse response (RIR) processing, designed to calculate key acoustical parameters such as EDT, T20, T30, C50, C80, IACC, and IACC-early, in accordance with ISO 3382.
									In addition, the software computes the transition time (Tt), enabling the calculation of EDTt, CTt, and IACCt, which provide valuable insight into early sound field behavior.
									</p> Calculations can be performed for octave or third-octave bands, following IEC 61260 filter specifications. The program also supports multiple RIR processing, allowing users to analyze either averaged or individual measurements.
									The developed software was compared with commercial tools such as EASERA, Aurora, and AARAE, demonstrating good agreement and consistent results. The code was written in Python and is available online for public access.

									<p><u><i>Control room design (2021)</i></u>: 
									The project involved the design of an anechoic control room for a recording studio with a capacity for eight people, in compliance with DISPO regulations of CABA, Argentina.
									Five different monitoring systems were implemented: two for stereo productions, one for binaural audio, and one for 3D audio productions. The design also included detailed acoustic 
									treatment and soundproofing calculations. The measured reverberation times were within the tolerances established by the AES.
									To support the design, several analytical tools and methods were employed. Boundary Element Method (BEM) simulations were used to analyze room modes below the Schroeder frequency, 
									while absorption and diffusion simulations were conducted to achieve an optimal reverberation time (RT) across all frequency bands. Additionally, transmission loss calculations were 
									performed to ensure compliance with Law No. 1540.
									The study also included an analysis of multichannel monitoring configurations and a review of commercially available loudspeakers, as well as the ventilation requirements necessary 
									to maintain low CO₂ levels within the control room.
