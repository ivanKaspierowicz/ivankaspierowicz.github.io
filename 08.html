									The design proposed is the creation of a guitar cabinet emulator with two selections, Marshall style and Mesa-Boogie with an extra two bands EQ active filter.
									Through the series connection of different filters, it was possible to imitate the frequency response of these cabinets in a way
									quite satisfactory. Once obtained the two RIR's from a professional company through a subjective preference selection a 
									frequency analysis is done and three points of reference are selected (a,b, and c for both RIR's).</p><br>

									to make drafts and simulate them digitally until the objectives set out above were reached. The simulations involve four different filter topologies: Sallen key High-Pass filter with
									a cut frequency (fc) of 90 Hz and 12 dB/oct decay; Sallen key Low-Pass filter with an fc of 6 kHz and 12 dB/oct; two resonant filters with central frequencies in 111 Hz and 625 Hz with 
									selectivity factor (Q) of 2 and 5 accordingly; finally a Notch filter with a center frequency of 330 Hz. Then, the experimental circuit is executed in a breadboard to facilitate the possible
									changes along with the measurements. </p><br>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05_1.jpg" alt="" /></span> The final results are measured with a band-limited pink noise and then a subjective test is made. Even if the results 
									don't show a perfect correlation between the original impulse responses the subjective test reveals a great sound and reaches the principal aim of this work which is to get a good tone when an electric guitar
									is used through a speaker monitor.   </p><br><br><br><br>-->

									<p>This section shows the professional recordings
									made over the Master. Some music genres involved are Jazz, Folklore, Rock, and classical music and take place in iconical recording studios such as Panda (Charly Garcia,
									Los abuelos de la nada, Mercedes Sosa, Etc).   </p>
									<p>Make a professional recording starts when the musicians arrive at the studio.
									Is necessary to understand what music they do and set up an audio reference (depending on the genre), then the selection of the best microphones to make
								 	a reality that sound in the engineer's mind. During the recording, the musicians must have the best audio return possible to improve their comfort. The last step is 
									to make the mix of the song setting the places of the instruments and a characteristical sound.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic08_4.jpg" alt="" /></span></p><br><br>
									<p>The samples show some mixes made for elite musicians like Mario Parmisano (pianist: Al di Meola, Chick corea, Herbie Hancock,...)
									in a concert made in the Auditorium in the Tres de Febrero University. In other genres like folklore the artist Diego arolfo with an extensive music trajectory in Argentina and the World.</p><br><br>-->

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08_1.jpg" alt="Auditorium design 3D render"/><p>This section reveals some of the most important projects that i have been made through my journey in the university. For context, you can see
										the wide range of assigments and the workload in the following link <a href="https://untref.edu.ar/uploads/Programas/programas-carreras/Ing.%20de%20Sonido%20-%20Plan%202007%20-%20RM%201964-07.pdf"> "Ing. De Sonido - Plan 2007" (spanish only).</a></p>
									<p><u><i>Auditorium design (2019)</i></u>: A concert hall was designed at the site of the existing auditorium, Teatro Auditorium in Buenos Aires.
										Possible surrounding noise sources are people movement and heavy traffic. The building consists of a lobby,
										ticket office, cafeteria/bar, dressing rooms and practice rooms for performers, restroom, staff office, machine
										rooms as well as main hall space. In the hall, 960 seats were arranged in two levels according to Buenos
										Aires city’s building code. The materials realized the reverberation time of 1.97 s at middle frequencies.
										The triangular reflector panel was designed above the frontal audience to improve the initial time delay gap
										between 15 ms and 35 ms. The concert hall design through acoustic simulation software provides to the
										audience an SPL variation less than 4 dB, an EDT of 1.63 s at 1 kHz, and an IAGG of 0.25 s at 1 kHz.

									</span><u><i>RIR software (2021)</i></u>: APC is a software developed for the room impulse response processing for
									calculate the acoustical parameters EDT, T20, T30, C50, C80, IACC, and IACC-early, according
									to ISO-3382. In addition, transition time (Tt) is calculated, allowing to calculate EDTt, CTt, and
									IACCt, and giving an approach of early sound field behavior. Calculations can be made for octave
									or third-octave bands, according to IEC-61260 filters specifications. Also, multiple RIRs can be
									processed, allowing the user to analyze the averaged or the individual measurements. The
									software developed is compared with commercial software EASERA, Aurora, and AARAE,
									showing good and consistent results. The code is written in Python language and published
									online.</p>

									<p><u><i>Control room design (2021)</i></u>: Design of a ambechoic control room for a recording studio,
										with 8 people capacity according to the DISPO regulations of CABA, Argentina. Five different monitoring
										systems were installed, two for stereo productions, one for binaural audio productions, and
										one for 3D audio productions. Acoustic treatment and soundproofing calculations are also
										included. The obtained reverberation time were within the tolerances established by the AES.
										Some tools used to provide the design of the control room are the BEM (Boundary element method) simulations 
										to study the modes below the Schroeder frequency, the simulation of the absorption and diffusion to provide an optimal RT all across the frequency bands, and the trasmission loss calculation
										in order to satisfy the law N°1540. Furthermore, the analysis of multichannel monitoring and the speakers often in the market, and the calculation of the ventilation required to
										keep low levels of C02 in the control room.  </p>
